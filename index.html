		  <h2>About Me</h2>
		  <p>I'm friendly and inquisitive. I like meeting people from different backgrounds and learning new skills. I'm passionate about music and dance, and I care about world politics. I also love language, I'm a bit of a grammar nerd, and have an eye for out-of-place punctuation, which is proving very useful in coding!</p>
		  <h3>What's important to me</h3>
		  <p>My family, having access to books and music, having meaningful relationships with people, and eating good food. </p>

		  <h2>My background</h2>
		  <p>I've just come back from two years teaching English in South America, but I previously specialised in marketing and communications and managed content for several websites, which is how I became fascinated with the 'behind the scenes' of the internet.</p>
		  <p>So I decided to learn all about it - and here I am :) I'm very excited about this new curve in my career, I love the learning process and the challenge of problem-solving that is so inherent to writing code. I look forward to getting the opportunity to create web platforms in the professional world.</p>
		  <h3>Where I'm from</h3>
		  <p>I'm from beautiful Paris, France, but have lived most of my adult life in the UK, and love how London seems to constantly burst with new people and things to do.</p>

		  <h2>What I like</h2>

		    <ul>
		      <li>Jungle - beegees-like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcsfftwLUf0">funky soul</a> from the UK. I recently saw them live, they were sensational.</li>
		      <li>Buddy Rich and his orchestra - old-school jazz, great <a  href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDQkba0yKJA">background music</a> for cooking or working.</li>
		    </ul>
